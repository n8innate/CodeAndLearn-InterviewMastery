### Problem Description:
Create a simple Node.js application that reads a JSON file containing an array of numbers and outputs the sum, average, and product of those numbers.

### Requirements:

1. Create a JSON file named `numbers.json` and populate it with an array of numbers. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    }
    ```

2. In your Node.js application, read the `numbers.json` file.
  
3. Calculate the sum, average, and product of the numbers.

4. Output these values to the console.

### Expected Output:
For the example JSON file provided, the output should be:
```
Sum: 15
Average: 3
Product: 120
```

### Tips:
- Use the `fs` module to read the JSON file.
- Use the `JSON.parse()` method to convert the JSON string to a JavaScript object.

This problem will help you practice file reading, JSON parsing, and basic math operations in Node.js. Enjoy coding!
