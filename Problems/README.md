# Practice Problems

Instructions for usage should go as follows:
1. Potential practice-problems should go under either Algos or DataStructures
2. Before the week begins decide on a pair partner, create a directory with your names under the relevant week
3. Practice problems can be copied from Algos or DataStructures, then push up solutions you work on with your partner so others can review
