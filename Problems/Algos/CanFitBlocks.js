/*
* Function: canFitBlocks
* 
* Parameters: 
*   - operations: An array of tuples where each tuple represents a block. 
*     - If the first element is 1, it's a test block, and the other two numbers represent its dimensions.
*     - If the first element is 0, it's an experiment block, and the other two numbers represent its dimensions.
*
* Returns:
*   - An array of boolean values, one for each test block in the operations array.
*     - true means all experiment blocks can fit into the test block either vertically or horizontally.
*     - false means at least one experiment block cannot fit into the test block.
*
* Description:
*   The function checks if each "experiment block" can fit into a "test block" either vertically or horizontally.
*   For optimization, experiment blocks are sorted by dimensions so that non-viable blocks are filtered out early.
